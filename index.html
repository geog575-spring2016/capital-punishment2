  <h1><b>[Context Section]</b></h1></br><br>
<h2> [Title of Section One Goes Here] </h2>
  The history of Americaâ€™s laws on capital punishment have been inconsistent and indefinite.  In 1972 capital punishment was suspended however it resumed in 1976 with a case of first degree murder in North Carolina (Woodson vs. Roberts) in the US Supreme Court.  The United States suspended the death penalty again in September 2007 but it was resumed again in April 2008. America is one of the few first world country that still uses capital punishment in our justice system.  In 2015 the United States had the 5th highest death penalty rate with 28 people executed, following China, Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.  Although many believe that this is an archaic practice America has put laws in place to try and modernize this outdated practice by making it unconstitutional to execute anyone under the age or 16 and of insane persons. However, there are some obsolete modes the capital punishment is carried out such as; burning, firing squad, hanging, gas, electrocution, injection and several others are ways. The scariest part of the death penalty is the amount of wrongful convictions.  There has been a decrease in the number of people convicted for the death penalty and the number of executions that have been carried out, which shows us the direction that America is moving toward.
