<h2>Brief History of Capital Punishment in the United States</h2> <p>
  When European settlers came to North America, they brought Britain’s practice of death
  penalty with them. The death penalty remained a part of the colonies and the young United
  States up until the early twentieth century, when several states either outlawed or reduced
  capital punishment. It wasn’t until the 1960s when the Supreme Court began taking a closer
  look at capital punishment. In Furman v. Georgia, it was argued that capital cases were often
   arbitrary and capricious. It was thus determined to be “cruel and unusual”, which led the
   Supreme Court to invalidate the legality of capital punishment. </br><br>
  The decade-long suspension of the death penalty was brought to an end with the Gregg v.
  Georgia case and the subsequent execution of Gary Gilmore in Utah by firing squad in 1977.

<br><br>
<h2>Moratoriums, Formal Holds, and De Facto Moratoriums, oh my!</h2> <p>
Determining when and where the death penalty is legal in the United States is some complicated business.
While creating this interactive, we learned that the system does not simply rely on the binary legal versus
illegal; rather, other statuses exist such as a Moratorium, a De Facto Moratorium, a Formal Hold, and a
De Facto Momento.

</br></br>
Particularly in the cases of De Facto Moratoriums and De Facto Momento, it is difficult to find reliable
information about the exact starting and ending dates for each of these phases (particularly since "de facto",
by definition, means "not by law").

</br></br>
For the sake of clarity, we chose to stick to the legal versus illegal binary in our map because that
is considered the "official status" for each state during the given year.
<br><br>
<h2>Death of the Death Penalty?</h2> <p>
David von Drehle, an author at TIME, staunchly believes that the death penalty is going to draw to a close
in the United States (though he does not specify when). However, as this interactive shows, there has been no dearth of executions since
the last time the death penalty nearly ended due to it being deemed "cruel and unusual". What are some reasons von Drehle
believes we will reach the end of the death sentence?
</br></br>
For one, he notes that the process is not particularly simple. Even with lethal injection, which is the most
"sanitized" method for execution that allows us to escape the gruesome nature of the practice, it does not
always work as expected.
</br></br>
Another reason von Drehle posits is that crime rates have fallen in the past decades (particularly in
comparison to 1990s rates), so public opinion is less in favor of the death penalty in general. It just
seems less necessary.
</br></br>
Another reason is simply that capital punishment comes with a hefty price tag. One may believe
it is less costly than a life sentence for a prisoner, but in actuality, the death penalty
can cost significantly more than life imprisonment due to additional costs of housing a
death row inmate, according to the Huffington Post.
</br></br>
None of this necessarily means that the death penalty will come to an end soon, but it is worth
considering if the death penalty is worthwhile for the United States.
